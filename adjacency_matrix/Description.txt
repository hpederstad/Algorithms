Write a C++ program called adj_matrix.cpp that converts a directed graph stored in an input file into an adjacency matrix format.
Your program should get an input file name from a user first.
Then, it should read the content of the file and display the graph in the adjacency matrix format.
In the assignment, you can assume that the maximum number of vertices in the input graph is less than or equal to 50. 
 
Input file format: This is a sample input file called t1.txt.

3
2
0 1
1 2

The first line (= 3 in the example) indicates that there are three vertices in the graph.
The second line (= 2 in the example) presents the number of edges in the graph.
The remaining two lines are the edge information in the graph.
For the program, you should assume that the first vertex starts from the number 0.

One blank space is used to delimiter the data.
Note that there’s no blank space at the end of each line.

The following presents a sample run of the C++ program.
Your program must run exactly like this.
Note that the bold text is a user’s input. 
 
$ g++ -o adj_matrix adj_matrix.cpp
$ ./adj_matrix
Enter input file name: C:\\tmp\\t1.txt
Number of vertices: 3
Number of edges: 2
Adjacency matrix:
	0 1 0
	0 0 1
	0 0 0
